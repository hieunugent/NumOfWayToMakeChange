# NumberOfWaysToMakeChange
- given an array of positive integer which representing coin denominations 
- and a single non- negative integer n representing a target amount of money
- write a function that return ways number to make a change for giving target amount of money
- example : n = 6 , demons = [1, 5]
- the output should be 2;
- time complexity is O(nD) n is number of target number, D is the Number of Denomination  length
- Space COmplexity is O(n) is the number of Target number, which used to hold the ways
